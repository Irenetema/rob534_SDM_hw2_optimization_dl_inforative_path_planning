The file "main.py" is the file you should run

** Start by choosing which navigator (greedy or informed) you want to use by setting which_navigator to either 0 or 1 (0 = greedy_navigator and 1 = informed_navigator)

----> which_navigator = 1  # 0 = greedy_navigator; 1 = informed_navigator
	
	
	
** You can decide to visualize the trajectory found by the navigator by setting plot_trajectories to either True or False

----> plot_trajectories = False
	
	
	
** Once you have defined the parameters, run the file "main.py"

By default, the code will run 10 episodes with different digits, then compute the average score and display it in the console.
